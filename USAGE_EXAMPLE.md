Usage example with [chords2midi](https://colab.research.google.com/github/olaviinha/MusicWithChatGPT/blob/main/chords2midi.ipynb?force_theme=dark) notebook:

Once you have the notebook open and you have executed the Setup cell, you may naturally copy/paste and download new chord progressions as many times as you like:

In this latter example
- we untick `auto_download` -> Download buttons will appear instead of automatic downloads
- we tick `midi_file_per_line` -> a separate midi file will be generated for each line of text we pasted in the right side box (Verse, Chorus and Bridge will be in their own midi files)
